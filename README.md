# Summer-2021

These are the programs I created to help me solve problems presented to me in the class or as a project assigned by the professor.
The 2 courses I took were MATH 482 (Combinational Algorithms) and COMP 380 (Introduction to Software Engineering). 
In MATH 482, my main project was solving the Josephus Problem. In COMP 380, we were learning inheritance.
